  "description": [
    "Law is a close range, poking-based, slide archetype character with strong neutral tools and strong block punishment. A legacy character with traditionally challenging execution, he is very accessible this time around and is suitable for anyone looking to live out their Bruce Lee fantasy.",
    "Law has an extensive moveset that allows for flexibility in terms of playstyle - shifting between aggressive, sticky pressure with tools like the Dragon Hammer (f+1+2), forcing counter hit situations with his i10 1,2,3 and i13 4,3; and a mix of backdashing and whiff punishment with 3+4,4 and b+2,1. Though Law now has easier inputs to access his slide mixups and Dragon Charge (DSS) stance, he still rewards oldheads for their legacy skills just frames for extra damage.",
    "Law thrives when in poke range, but can struggle to close the gap, putting the onus on a player's movement and ability to get around their opponent's keepout. He embodies the philosophy of a \"death by a thousand cuts\", and lacks strong mixups to make a comeback against an opponent who refuses to get counterhit."
