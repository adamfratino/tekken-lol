  "description": "Marshall Law is a renowned martial arts master and runs his own dojo. However, he fell into debt due to his son's motorcycle accident, and his efforts to repay this debt caused him to neglect the management of his dojo, resulting in a sharp drop-off of students coming to train. Law set out to find a distinguished master who could take over the dojo and solve all his troubles. Unfortunately, all negotiations ended in failure, and to make matters worse, his dojo was repossessed as collateral while he was gone. Now plunged into poverty, Law became bound by the concept of money making the world go round. His only hope was to make a killing at the next tournament and secure the prize money he so desperately needed. To increase his chances of success, he promised to split the winnings with his friend Paul Phoenix. Together, the pair journeyed to the mountains in order to train."
