  "tagline": "Destroying Automation",
  "country": "Russia",
  "style": "Thruster-Based High-Mobility Fighting Style",
  "description": [
    "Alisa is fast and evasive poking character who excels at darting around her opponent while peppering them quick moves. Her strong movement allows her to gracefully step around her opponent's attacks, making it difficult to pin her down. On the offense, her frustrating array of pokes can whittle down an opponent or provoke them into doing something stupid. She can also mixup her opponent with dual chainsaws, that in Heat, will quickly rip apart an opponent's grey life. She's great for players looking to play a fast, hit-and-run playstyle that emphasizes movement.",
    "Due to her primarily poke-based offense, she can struggle to make comebacks against a deep life deficit. She doesn't hit hard, and needs to win more interactions than her opponent to take the round."
