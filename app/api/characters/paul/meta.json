  "description": "Paul Phoenix is a hot-blooded martial artist aiming to be the greatest fighter in the universe. He entered the seventh The King of Iron Fist Tournament with his eyes on the exorbitant prize money, more assured than ever that this time he would claim victory. The tournament, however, would be suspended with the disappearance of its organizer. Paul received barely a fraction of the fight money he had been counting on, plunging him into a life of destitution. All he could do was take a gamble that the next tournament would be able to provide him with sufficient compensation. To that end, he promised to split his next winnings with his good friend and sparring partner, Marshall Law. The pair holed up in the mountains for an intense training session in order to prepare for the tournament"
