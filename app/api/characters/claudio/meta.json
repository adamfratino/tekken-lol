  "tagline": "Banisher of Demons",
  "country": "Italy",
  "style": "Sirius Exorcist Arts",
  "description": [
    "Claudio, the flamboyant Italian exorcist, is a simple, straightforward and no-nonsense character who relies on controlling space in order to lock his opponents down, allowing him to setup mixups or pressure. He possesses a limited but effective set of tools to implement this gameplan, allowing the player to quickly achieve character fluency with him and focus on developing their fundamentals and match-up knowledge. In Heat, his mixups become deadlier, with a low Heat Smash and a safe mid launcher.",
    "Claudio can struggle to deal with patient opponents. His low mixup options are generally low damage and risky, making it painful for him to have them blocked. He must condition his opponents that much more with mids to ensure they aren't tempted to duck."
