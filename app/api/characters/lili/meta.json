  "description": "Daughter of a wealthy oil magnate from Monaco who, despite her pampered upbringing, loves to fight. Keeping it a secret from her peace-loving father, Lili uses the family private jet to fly around the globe in search of worthy opponents to hone her skills. All of it to defeat her eternal rival, Asuka Kazama, who has beaten her twice in The King of Iron Fist Tournament. Lili buys the Kazama family's dojo with her pocket money, decorates the entire dojo with roses, and sends Asuka a formal challenge. Imagining Asuka's angry face, Lili smiles elegantly while petting her cat, Salt."
