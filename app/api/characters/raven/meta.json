  "description": "Codename: Raven. An agent and ninjutsu master, he is tasked with special ops missions for the UN's independent forces. Raven has engaged in missions all over the world, utilizing his ninjutsu to put a stop to conflicts before they even begin. However, the brutal power struggle between the Mishima Zaibatsu and G Corp threatens to bring the entire globe to its knees, and Raven only sees more chaos on the horizon. To face the challenges that lie ahead, he must continue to push past his limits. With this in mind, Raven sets out to train with his ninjutsu master once more. While the top brass admires Raven's resolve and accepts his request to go train, their approval comes with a condition: they will only cover his absence for half a year. Aiming to maximize his results in a limited time frame, Raven decides to focus on honing the arts he already excels at. Months pass, and he masters a new art, \"Shadow Clone,\" just as he receives orders to return. Thus, Raven leaves the training grounds behind, anticipating the new battle that awaits him."
