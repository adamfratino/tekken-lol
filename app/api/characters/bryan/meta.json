  "style": "Kickboxing",
  "description": [
    "Bryan is Tekken's keep-out and counter hit monster. It is scary to press buttons against Bryan due to his plethora of CH-launching attacks and high combo damage. It is scary to not press buttons against Bryan due to his strong pressure tools, lows and the infamous Taunt Jet Upper, an unblockable launcher. Playing Bryan requires demanding execution, a mastery of Tekken fundamentals, and an understanding of how to stoke tension in your opponent. The reward is one of the scariest characters to press a button against in the entire game.",
    "Bryan's demanding execution and gameplan can make him difficult to approach for newcomers. He lacks defensive tools and puts the onus on the player to avoid getting pressured. His \"small Tekken\" is weak, and he can struggle against faster characters with better pokes."
