  "description": "Raised in a harsh environment as Heihachi Mishima's adopted son, Lee Chaolan now manages the global humanoid manufacturer, Violet Systems. Lee carries with him a bitter hatred of both Heihachi and Kazuya Mishima, and when he first meets Lars Alexandersson—a man who stands in opposition of the Mishima Zaibatsu—he intends to use him as a pawn for his own revenge. However, Lee comes to sympathize with Lars's honest and excellent desire for peace. With the sincere intention of supporting Lars's plan, Lee teams up with him to form the rebel army \"Yggdrasil\" and begins working as a staff officer. Meanwhile, Kazuya leads G Corp and shows no sign of slowing his invasions, despite G Corp's defeat of the Mishima Zaibatsu. The world is being brought to its knees under a brutal wave of military rule. But Lee knows his adopted brother Kazuya inside and out, and he's started to fully use his knowledge and vast resources to develop a variety of weapons. With the help of the ingenious scientist Dr. Bosconovitch, he constructs the enormous flying boat, \"Víðópnir,\" in addition to developing mobile warfare units using motorbikes. With these, the rebel army is able to start pushing back against G Corp in every region. Lee also invests in a next-gen battle suit perfect for close-range combat that will act as a trump card against the enemy's impenetrable armor. It is called the Violet Suit, a marvelous creation that utilizes sophisticated technologies and is equipped with numerous features that reflect Lee's own aesthetics. Lee struts onto the battlefield in this new armor, ready to take on whatever may come."
