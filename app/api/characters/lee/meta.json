  "tagline": "Silver-Haired Demon",
  "country": "Japan",
  "style": "Martial Arts",
  "description": [
    "Lee is a stylish, counterhit-focused character who rewards mastery. He has counterhits for days, and can fish for them while representing any kind of playstyle, whether poking or keepout. Lee boasts the highest number of just frames in the game, including the strongest i10 punisher in the game in Acid Rain. Along with high combo damage and wall carry, Lee truly rewards excellence, and time spent mastering the character.",
    "Outside of enforcing the slide mixup, Lee can struggle to open up patient opponents, since his lows are risky or low reward. His demanding just frames require practice, and can be risky to get wrong. His Heat mode is quite underwhelming, offering up nothing more than making his just frames a bit easier."

  "strengths": [
    "Pressure: Lee boasts a plethora of powerful CH options as well as an oppressive WR3,4 and strong mid checks to keep opponents at bay.",
    "Amazing Wall Carry: Lee's loopable combo strings, particularly with b+2, have excellent potential for carrying opponents to the wall.",
    "Keepout: Tools such as b4 & ff3 allow Lee to keep the opponent outside of their perfect range.",
    "Full Crouch Mixups: In crouch, Lee has a multitude of options to mix the opponent up, such as the safe WS4 or the quick FC.df4 for a low risk mixup, or using his slide as well as WS2,3 for a more marvelous, but risky mixup.",
    "Defense and Punishment: Lee boasts the highest damage i10 punisher in the game. Many of his moves, including his Heat Engagers, are well suited to getting out of pressure."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Lows: Lee's lows are heavily poke oriented tools that tend to have poor advantage on hit in exchange for obnoxious range, visibility, and different punish requirements for mind games. Some lows require excellent spacing to be arguably safe. Though his b+3,3 is a good advantageous low string, it is launch punishable.",
    "Poor Heat: Lee's Heat is very underwhelming, with its only unique attribute being a more lenient window for his Just Frames. This benefit is negligible for players that can already land these consistently. His Heat Smash also does relatively low damage and is launch punishable.",
    "Execution: Lee is designed to reward execution heavy players. Though he may not have the hardest techniques in the game, full combos from CH d3 or CH 4,4,4 are tight, as well as his Just Frames demanding a bit more execution on things that other characters get for freeâ€”and in some cases, missing the timing can lead to you getting punished."
