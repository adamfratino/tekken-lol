After defeating his father Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya intensifies his offensive to eliminate the leaderless Mishima Zaibatsu. This brutal war divided the world in two, and in the end G Corporation came out on top. However, G corporation showed no signs of relenting, and continued to dominate the world by force. The Union of Nations was appalled by these actions, and they gathered various world leaders in New York to discuss how to impose sanctions against G Corporation.
