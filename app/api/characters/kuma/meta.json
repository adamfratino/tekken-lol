  "description": "Kuma is Heihachi Mishima's pet and a member of the Mishima Zaibatsu's special forces, Tekken Force. He never misses the chance to volunteer in disaster relief efforts all across Southeast Asia. Locals are always reluctant to accept Kuma at first, fearing that he might attack them. But, with his playful nature and strong work ethic, Kuma gradually wins them over and becomes the town favorite. However, one fateful day, Heihachi left to settle the score with Kazuya Mishima, only to never be seen again. Kuma believes his master is still somewhere out there, but waits for his return to no avail. Meanwhile, G Corp is gaining the upper hand with their attacks against the Mishima Zaibatsu. Kuma bolts to the Mishima Zaibatsu building to provide backup. However, upon arriving, he realizes his chance to combat G Corp is long gone. The Mishima Zaibatsu leadership had surrendered, unable to wait any longer for Kuma. If Kuma lets the Zaibatsu be dismantled, then his master will have nowhere to come back to. And as Heihachi's loyal pet, that is the one thing he can not abide by. \"(I will continue fighting until Master Heihachi returns...even if it means I'm the last one standing!)\" In the spirit of Heihachi, Kuma trains to perfect his Mishima-style techniques. He dons the outfit and belt his master once wore, then begins his lonely fight. Several months pass, and Kuma—who had rescued Mishima Heavy Industries' elite engineers from the clutches of G Corp—has begun development on a secret weapon that is sure to change the game."
