She infiltrates the Mishima Zaibatsu building in search of clues to find a missing Jin and to obtain data that would prove helpful in her search. Traveling around the world and following whatever traces she can find, six months have passed for Xiaoyu with no hope in sight. Xiaoyu has run out of leads, but she simply must find Jin, no matter the cost. There is something she needs to know from him...
