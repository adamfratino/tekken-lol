  "description": [
    "Dragunov is an oppressive pressure and rushdown character who excels at freezing his opponents cold with powerful, plus-on-block mids, and then slicing them open with hard-hitting mixups, and a complete throw game. He combines strong poking and above-average movement and whiff punishment, making his \"small Tekken\" also difficult to deal with. In Heat, Dragunov's pressure becomes even more chilling due to the constant chip damage, which when coupled with his pokes, will punish you even for blocking.",
    "Dragunov is fairly simple and straightforward to use, and success with him is directly proportional to your skill. He is excellent for players looking to embody Tekken 8's aggressive philosophy and force their opponents to constantly block their big, strong buttons.",
    "Dragunov's pressure moves can be fairly linear, and require skill to land against opponents with good movement. Their slower startup also leaves Dragunov open to interruption, and he doesn't have the best tools to counterhit opponents trying to mash against him."
