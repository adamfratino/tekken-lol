  "description": [
    "Devil Jin is a versatile, mixup-oriented Mishima-style character. He has good tools to approach, pressure, mixup and keep out the opponent, a complete throw game, good block and whiff punishment tools and great combo damage. He has an answer for almost every situation, and it is up to the enterprising Devil Jin player to maximize his potential.",
    "Devil Jin's only real weakness are his poor generics - his jab has poor range, and his df+1 is quite bad on block. Otherwise, his weakness lies in his unforgiving nature; he requires good execution to make use of his key tools, the implementation of a complex game plan and high character knowledge to optimize him effectively."
