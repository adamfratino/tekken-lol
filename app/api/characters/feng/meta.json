  "description": "Feng Wei is a master of Taijiquan who, guided by the teachings of the God Fist scrolls, aims to become the perfect warrior who transcends all â€” the Dragon God. However, at the most recent King of Iron Fist Tournament, Feng suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Wing Chun master Leroy Smith. \"You will never reach the height of true martial arts with that heartless technique of yours. You are unworthy of even being compared to your master.\" The master to which Leroy refers is Wu Zihao, a martial artist who was known as the \"God Fist\" and under whose guidance Feng trained. In contrast to Feng, who believes that true martial arts reside in pure and unyielding power, his master Wu Zihao had always preached that it is essential for one's heart to be in line with one's technique. Whose belief holds the truth? Feng thought he had found the answer on the stormy night he killed his own master...yet his fight with Leroy seemed to say otherwise. (Wing Chun as a martial art is nearly invulnerable. Users turn their opponents' own power against them to control them. Even still, if one can just break through their defenses with overwhelming power, then...!) Feng uses his rage as fuel for his training, and travels to every corner of the globe, destroying masters who excel in self-defense as he grows even more powerful. Six months pass, and Nina Williams visits Feng with a proposal: she promises him that if he lends his support to G Corp, they will provide him with an opportunity to avenge himself against Leroy. Although he knows that such an offer means he will become an accomplice to G Corp, Feng gives his assent. Feng scoffs at the ridiculous concept of \"heart\" that his dead master and Leroy value so much, continuing down the path he must take to become the Dragon God."
