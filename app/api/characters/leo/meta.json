  "description": "Leo is a Bajiquan user born to Niklas Kliesen, a world-renowned archaeologist, and Emma Kliesen, an authority in genetic research. With a father versed in martial arts and an inquisitively minded mother, Leo uses these inherited skills to set off on a hunt for the truth behind the mysterious circumstances of Emma Kliesen's death one year prior. Risking life and limb, Leo obtains confidential data from G Corp that Emma Kliesen had been researching the devil gene there. From this data, Leo also learns that Kazuya Mishima had sent out orders that key researchers who were no longer needed were to be \"taken care of.\" Around the same time, the Mishima Zaibatsu announces that Kazuya Mishima, the mastermind behind G Corp, is himself a devil. In this moment, the puzzle pieces fall into place for Leo. Kazuya must have initiated the research so he could gain control over the devil's power, and then killed Leo's mother when she was no longer of use. Full of rage, Leo is on the verge of a breakdown. But suddenly, the words of Leo's father, who had gone missing many years ago, echo in Leo's ears. \"Listen, Leo. Like a lost coin, the truth is only found when your heart is calm and open.\" Yes. Just relax. That's all it takes. Spurred by these words, Leo sets out on another journey in search of more concrete answers."
