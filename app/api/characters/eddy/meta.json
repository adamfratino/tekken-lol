  "description": "Eddy Gordo is a skilled capoeira user who has devoted half his life to honing his skills so he can exact revenge on Kazuya Mishima for his father's death. One day, his capoeira master falls victim to an incurable disease. With no one else to turn to, Eddy pleads for help from the current head of the Mishima Zaibatsu, Jin Kazama. Jin agrees, but in exchange for medical care for his master, Eddy must join the Tekken Force. Knowing full well the weight of the sins he will bear, he is left with no choice but to participate in the destructive missions. However, his master succumbs to the illness nevertheless, rendering his sacrifice in vain. Lost in despair, Eddy abandons the Tekken Force and heads for G Corp's Millennium Tower. There, he cuts through countless G Corp soldiers, making his way to the top. However, in the face of Kazuya's overwhelming power, Eddy is defeated. \"Is this how my life is destined to end? Unable to exact vengeance or atone for my sins...?\" These are Eddy's final thoughts as his world begins to fade to black...until Yoshimitsu drops in from the sky to rescue him from the brink of death. Eddy narrowly escapes with his life, and a short time later, Yoshimitsu helps him reunite with an unexpected figure from his pastâ€”someone he hasn't seen in ten years. This person, too, wants to see the world freed from Kazuya's tyrannical reign, and it is their words that convince Eddy to join forces with them. \"No matter what hardships people face, they can always rise again.\" Bearing the weight of those words, Eddy puts himself on a grueling training regime to redeem his pride. With his master's teachings close to his heart and an unbridled love for the freedom capoeira gave him, Eddy hones his moves to new levels of proficiency. And after much meditation during his days of training, he comes to the realization that his abilities should not be used for revenge, but to save as many people as he can. This, he decides, is the best way to repay his father and master. And so, his journey of redemption begins.",
