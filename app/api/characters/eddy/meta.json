  "description": [
    "Eddy is a mid-ranged stance-based mixup character. His long legs come with good pokes, lows and plus frames to control the mid range. His strings allow him to play mindgames with his opponent by threatening extensions while transitioning into stance. He can flow into and out of his two stances, Negativa (RLX) and Bananeira (HSP), quite freely, while enforcing powerful mixups from each, allowing players to layer their mixups and keep their opponents guessing constantly.",
    "Being centered around mixups can backfire on Eddy, since it can be difficult to get consistent results with him. Against prepared opponents, it is a lot harder to utilize his strings and stances, since they require juggling a lot of options to get any reward from."

  "strengths": [
    "Can easily setup mixups to force the opponent to guess",
    "RLX and sidestep HSP stances make Eddy very evasive and tricky to pin down",
    "Eddy requires a lot of lab work to defend against"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Requires some very specific combos",
    "Struggles against opponents who know the matchup"
