  "description": "Zafina is a warrior born into a family of exorcists whose lineage dates back to the time of ancient dynasties. In her day-to-day life, however, she uses her exceptional spiritual abilities to earn a living as an astrologist. Only a few months ago, the earth-shattering clash between the two evil stars, Jin Kazama and Kazuya Mishima, led to the resurrection of the original devil Azazel, an evil whom Zafina's family had kept sealed away for generations. Jin is able to defeat Azazel by the skin of his teeth, but Azazel's spirit is indestructible and survives. Now, it is only a matter of time before Azazel is resurrected once again. In order to delay Azazel's return for as long as possible, Zafina seals away Azazel's spirit in her left arm using her family's secret arts. However, Azazel's power is far beyond what even she could have foreseen, and the devil begins to wrest control of Zafina's body and soul away from her again and again. An exhausted Zafina arrives at Sirius Sanctuary, the headquarters of the Sirius Marksmen, in a last-ditch effort just before losing consciousness. When she awakens, she finds herself surrounded by Ling Xiaoyu, who is devotedly attending to her recovery, and Claudio Serafino, who is applying a holy seal to her left arm. Deeming them worthy of her trust, Zafina confesses all to them. In return, the two promise to spare no effort in aiding her whenever she needs it. Shortly after, while under the protection of the Sirius Marksmen, Zafina struggles to find a way to change their doomed fate. From the countless futures she's seen, though, there seems to be only one way out. However, that path would come at a great cost..."
